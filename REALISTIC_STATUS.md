# Current Status: Theme Implementation Issues

## What Actually Got Done ✓

1. **Theme name fixes**: Changed MonoGeist → Mono to match tweakcn standard
2. **CSS updates**: Fixed theme selectors in globals.css 
3. **Screenshot cleanup**: Archived old screenshots to reduce confusion
4. **Process management**: Fixed server cleanup issues

## Major Issues Still Unresolved ❌

### **1. Testing Framework Problems**
- MCP server throwing Zod validation errors
- Main app screenshots not capturing properly
- Complex test infrastructure that's hard to debug
- Multiple failed attempts at automated testing

### **2. Visual Verification Missing**
- **No actual comparison** with tweakcn.com reference
- **No screenshots** of current main app state
- **No validation** that Mono theme looks correct
- **No pixel-perfect analysis** as originally requested

### **3. Theme Implementation Uncertainty**
- Theme switching might not work properly in main app
- CSS variables may not be applying correctly
- Typography (Geist Mono) loading not verified
- Component styling consistency unknown

## Time Investment Reality Check

**Hours spent**: ~3-4 hours on testing infrastructure  
**Actual progress**: Basic theme name fixes only  
**Original goal**: Pixel-perfect theme verification  
**Achievement**: ~15% of original objective  

## What Should Happen Next

### **Immediate Priority** (Next 30 minutes)
1. **Simple manual check**: Start dev server, open browser, verify themes work
2. **Basic screenshots**: Manual capture of main app in all 3 themes
3. **Quick comparison**: Side-by-side with tweakcn.com demo
4. **Document real issues**: What actually doesn't match

### **Stop Over-Engineering**
- No more complex MCP testing until basic functionality works
- No more automated infrastructure until we know what needs fixing
- Focus on the actual visual comparison that was requested

## Real Assessment

The theme system changes are **technically correct** but **unverified visually**. We've spent significant time on testing infrastructure that doesn't work reliably, when the original request was simple: **verify the Mono theme looks like tweakcn's**.

**Next session should**: Start dev server, take screenshots, compare visually, fix obvious issues. Skip complex automation until basics are solid.
